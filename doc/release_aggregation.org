  The repository has to be setup that contains all Os Update Packages.
  After each release the package has to be aggregated from its original repository
  e.g. usually the adaptation repository.

  For example like this:
  #+begin_src sh
  osc aggregatepac --nosources SOURCEPRJ SOURCEPAC DESTPRJ
  #+end_src

  You can also find [[https://github.com/SailfishOS-SonyXperia/build/blob/master/osc_aggregate_release_package.py][osc_aggregate_release_package.py]] as an example for a aggregate script.

  The name of the release aggregation repository has to be added as /osUpdatePackageRepo/
  in the [[file:configuration.org::*site][site]] section in the Cosu configuration.
